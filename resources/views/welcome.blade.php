                    You might wonder what gave me the idea of this site...
                    Have you ever had one of those days when you are completely
                    ready to throw your hands up in the air and yell, "I give up!"
                    <p> </p> 
                    That was my life!  I had a zillion chores on my mind that
                    needed to be done, but somehow could not convey to my family
                    all of the things that should be occuring to keep our house clean and our life a little more free of everyday chaos.
                    <p> </p> 
                    Now, I needed a way to change all of that for me.  I threw around many ideas and this is the one that I said, "That would be a great
                    help and mom cannot get blamed!"
                    <p> </p> 
                    So, I devised a way that the computer knew all of the chores that
                    our family needed to accomplish on a daily, weekly, bi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual basis. I then determined what age; soley based on my own children could do the chore. There are some adult only chores here and there that myself or my husband would have to do ourselves. But, in the end? Would that be that bad if I could have "someone" else tell my kids what to do!?!
                    <p> </p> 
                    What? You say, how can this be? With all of our modern technology, I decided to use it to my benefit! What if the computer would email the kids their chores, or even text them! I decided further research needed to be done.
                    <p> </p> 
                    My current practice with my kids was to have them complete a chore, take a picture with their phone and text it to me. I would then assign another chore and await their pictures so I knew the chores were completed even though my kids were off for the summer; but, mom and dad still were working!
                    <p> </p> 
                    My husband being the gadget person he is, loaded an app on his phone that actually allows you to turn off or on your TV from anywhere. Wow! Those chores were finished quickly!  The downside was that mom just could not remember all of the things that needed
                    to be done and "lists" were always "lost" in my house.
                    <p> </p> 
                    Of course, I have had multiple ideas on other things that would make my life easier and maybe one day, you will get to enjoy them, too. My hope is that even though I created this  with my family in mind and hopefully, you'll find it useful for your family, too!
